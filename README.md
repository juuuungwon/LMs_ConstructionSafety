# LMs_ConstructionSafety
The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate prototypes of a construction safety specialized LLM and RAG model.

## RAG Model
To utilize the RAG model, the dump file of the Knowledge Graph (KG) is installed on Neo4j.

The pipeline of the RAG model is .

## Fine-Tuning Model
For the fine-tuning process, a QA dataset is utilized. This dataset is based on KOSHA GUIDELINES published by the Korean Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

The dataset is uploaded on HuggingFace: [DBCMLAB/Constructionsafety_QApairs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DBCMLAB/Constructionsafety_QApairs).

The fine-tuned model is uploade on HuggingFace: .[DBCMLAB/KoAlpaca-Pyglot-12.8B-ConstructionSafety](https://huggingface.co/DBCMLAB/KoAlpaca-Pyglot-12.8B-ConstructionSafety).
